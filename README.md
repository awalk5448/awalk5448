## Ashley Walker

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Ashley, a creative thinker and problem-solver passionate about bringing ideas to life with code.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently diving deep into web development as a student at the **SheCodes bootcamp**. My goal is to build beautiful, intuitive, and accessible digital experiences. I love finding new ways to combine the technical challenge of coding with my passion for creative expression.

ðŸš€ When I'm not coding, you can find me writing fiction and poetry on my WordPress blog (canvasofreflections.com), painting, or sketching.
